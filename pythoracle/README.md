# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:
npx hardhat verify --network mantleTestnet 0x68BB922f1c1466108206D873c370617697Cd4271 0x98046Bd286715D3B0BC227Dd7a956b83D8978603
```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
